:body: "As [Alfred App](http://www.alfredapp.com) turned 5 years old last week and
  I've been lucky to work on the design, branding and UI during that period, I thought
  I would document how it has evolved.\n\n###Alfred beta\n\nWhen [Vero](https://twitter.com/vero)
  and [Andrew](https://twitter.com/preppeller) came to me in 2009 with an idea for
  a new quick launcher for OSX, I jumped at the chance to create the original branding
  and website. They had a name –Alfred– but nothing else, so we thrashed out some
  ideas. Alfred is a quintessentially British name, so it inspired us to go with a
  classic bowler hat with an old-style magnifying glass for the app icon. I then proceeded
  to sketch out some initial ideas and throw some shapes in illustrator. Having never
  worked on an app icon for OSX before, I had to research best practices for formats
  and tools to create the icon. It also involved learning how to use the mesh tool
  in illustrator, which can be rather daunting when you've never used it before. We
  worked through some iterations shown below before we settled on the Alfred beta
  icon.\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/d2cez67fyqn0y68/alfred-icon-ideas.jpg\"

  alt=\"Alfred Beta Icon\"></figure>\n\nThe next thing we needed to work on was the
  website. It had to be simple (reflecting the app itself), impactful and beautiful.
  I went with a simple 2-colour design with centered text and some small decoration
  items.  The beta version launched in March 2010.\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/ys2iac9glve77rd/alfred-beta-site.jpg\"
  alt=\"Alfred Beta Site\"></figure>\n\nIt went down quite well within the design
  community, even drawing the attention of a few 'web celebrities'!\n\n<figure class=\"client-blockquote\">\n

  up - v1\n\nThe beta period was very well received by the Apple community and Andrew
  and Vero continued to refine the UI and add features based on the feedback from
  the beta launch. The version numbers were growing rapidly and we were nearing the
  launch of v1 in 2011. With this came a need to re-design the website and work on
  some of the interface iconography for the new features. We decided to keep the icon
  the same for now and just focus on a fresh look for the website plus the introduction
  of the Powerpack. I also worked with Andrew on some of the UI design for the Powerpack
  features. Andrew, who is also an excellent UI designer as well as a developer, already
  had most of the UI planned out so we just researched some ideas together for various
  aspects of the interface. A lot of this work was simplified down or shelved in the
  end but it's interesting to see some of the work in progress.\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/76ozyvq7ixnd0ju/alfred-v1-site.jpg\"

  alt=\"Alfred V1 Install window\"></figure>\n\nWe also added a few variations on
  the Alfred icon for other features or marketing campaigns.\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/32k0b1guvbgs4ex/alfred-v1-logo-variations.jpg\"

  gave us the chance to not only refine and iterate on a lot of work we had done before,
  but also give a fresh lick of paint to the App icon and iconography. For the Alfred
  icon, I played around with new textures for the hat and better lighting, but the
  main focus was on making the magnifying glass look more realistic. I experimented
  with thick and thin bezels, leather textures, new lighting sources for the metal
  frame and even gold!\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/3zi78ovex2815vu/alfred-v2-logo-ideas.jpg\"
  alt=\"Alfred V2 Logo ideas\"></figure>\n\nIn the end we settled on a thinner bezel
  silver frame and adding a new leather texture on the handle, with better lighting
  and shadow effects for the glass and frame. \n\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/36ftb3etynaxnmz/alfred-v2-logo-final.jpg\"
  alt=\"Alfred V2 Logo final\"></figure>\n\nThe iconography needed updating for the
  new retina screens that were just being released. Luckily I had done all the originals
  as vectors so it was just a case of redrawing a few to make them look more realistic
  and then updating the sizes and tweaking some of the paths to make sure all the
  pixels looked sharp and crisp.\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/h09ftlxnq0iot6h/alfred-v2-icons.jpg\"
  alt=\"Alfred V2 Logo icons\"></figure>\n\nFor the website, Andrew & Vero didn't
  want to completely overhaul the look and feel we had defined with V1, so it was
  more a case of giving it a fresh look and bringing it up-to-date. We stripped it
  back to be more minimal and refined with small hints of the Alfred wallpaper and
  other decorative elements. It was also built responsively to work across all devices.
  Alfred V2 launched in 2013.\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/dmhopj4fqrf54y4/alfred-v2-site.jpg\"
  alt=\"Alfred V2 site\"></figure>\n\n###Alfred Remote and beyond\n\nLate last year
  and early this year, I got to work on Alfred's newest product: Remote. The website
  needed to fit in with the current look and feel but also stand by itself as a separate
  micro-site. We used a fixed header photo led approach with a new intro video and
  a simple stripped back layout for the rest of the page.\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/gcrmx914gnrv9vv/alfred-remote-site.jpg\"
  alt=\"Alfred Remote site\"></figure>\n\nSo there you have it, an overview of how
  the Alfred brand and design has evolved over the last 5 years. Who knows what will
  happen with v3?"
