    testimonial: "We had tried to create a reporting website but lacked the technical skills. In order to make a one stop shop for citizen science reporting, we have transitioned our reporting website over to Water Rangers. Having their technical skills to create the website they have has been a great asset."

    main_text: "<p>Taylor Statten Camps have been around for over a century, and they have a reputation for immersive canoeing and camping experiences that allow kids to disconnect from technology, learn skills and create lasting memories. Their website, which was a few years old, wasn’t representing their ethos of simplicity any more as they grew and it became overly complex.</p>"
    sub_text: "<p>We redesigned this rustic camp website to simplify their user’s journey, to help them increase registrations and to maintain their reputation as a canoe camp in Algonquin Park. This redesign saw them increase their camp registrations in the first year. New and old campers loved the focus on imagery, showing the distinct separation between boys and girls camps, and the improved navigation helped them find the information they needed.</p>"
