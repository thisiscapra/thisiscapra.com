She worked on making history and tracking progress more gameful and delightful. She was also the designer for the original version of the iPhone app, which was built to focus users on quick and easy access to their daily gaming activities.

    home_intro: The interactive iPad game for babies
    main_text: "Dragimals is a fun &#8216;sticky&#8217; game, where small children can create scenes with delightful animating animals! After finding that there was a lack of simple, fun and easy to play apps for babies and toddlers, Kat designed this mini-game to focused less on game progression and more on teaching gestures and interactions. Dragimals is designed by Kat, and built by developer <a href='http://kickcode.com' alt='KickCode'>Elliott Draper</a>. "
    sub_text: "Smaller babies just drag the animals onto the scene and delight in pressing each one animate and make noises.  Older kids can play a more difficult version where they have to drag the animals to specific spots to see their rewards (which includes confetti for each correct placement and a celebration when they complete the scene). Learning about usability for babies was very interesting because they lacked to mobile dexterity and symbol recognition that older kids have developped."
