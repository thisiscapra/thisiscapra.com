    <h1>Designing technology for environmental data</h1>
    <p>Environmental data management is far behind where it needs to be. Lack of adequate tools and support are holding back progress on environmental issues. To pull environmental monitoring forward we need easy and usable data management systems in place. And that's where Capra comes in.</p>

      <p>So, how does your organization handle the collection, management, and sharing of your environmental data?</p>
      <h2>Let us help</h2>
      <p>We build gorgeous, custom digital solutions for the collection, management and sharing of environmental data. Water quality is our specialty, but we do everything. And by the way, we also develop the data collection kits to collect parameters in the field.</p>
      <p>Capra is a solution to very specific issues that our founders recognized and addressed in their environmental science work.  Designing environmental monitoring kits, developing open data standards, establishing successful monitoring programs, and building data sharing platforms used by millions of people are just a few examples of the solutions we've executed.</p>

        <blockquote>It might not be surprising that the best website and app for people to easily share and learn about water quality data is being developed right here in Ontario. To date, Water Rangers has produced an OUTSTANDING website allowing people who live on, or care about, lakes and rivers to upload their water quality data (e.g. total phosphorus) or observations (e.g. algae blooms) and share these data or observations with others in an easy to understand and accessible format.</blockquote>

In order to make a one stop shop for citizen science reporting, we have transitioned our reporting website over to Water Rangers. Having their technical skills to create the website they have has been a great asset.</blockquote>
