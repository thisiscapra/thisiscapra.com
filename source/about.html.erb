    <h1>About Capra</h1>

    <p class="intro">Capra is a small design team based in Ottawa, Canada run by husband and wife team Ollie and Kat Kavanagh.</p>

    <p>Our focus is great design for great projects. We love interactive work like websites, games and apps because we get involved in building what we design. For simple projects, we take care of all the development. </p>
    <p>For bigger projects, we like to team up with talented developers, product managers and marketers as they plan and code up the project to make sure we keep our design vision intact. We believe the best work comes from great collaboration! </p>

    <p>We also work with developers to implement our designs right into languages such as ruby-on-rails, python, php, unity, .net, xCode and java. We are always experimenting with the latest tools to use the right solution for a problem. </p>
    <p><strong>We also like to iterate our designs based on real-world testing.</strong> When real people are using our designs, we can further improve on the best practices we always implement upfront.  We have long-term clients who we love to work with to achieve their goals and through testing we have improved conversion rates and reduced confusion.</p>

    <p>Capra is a genus of mammals that contains both wild and domestic goats. Goats are known to be intelligent, adaptive and playful. Just like goats, we love to explore new technologies, explore new places and play games.  While we don&#8217;t own any goats yet, we hope to someday!</p>

        <h3>Ollie Kavanagh</h3>
        <h4>Designer, coder, problem solver</h4>
        <p>Ollie is a rare designer: he is equally comfortable designing beautiful, elegant interfaces (with superb typography)  as he is delving into the front-end code.  He is responsible for setting up processes for Capra&#8217;s technology.</p>
        <p>Ollie is originally from England and has just immigrated to Canada!  He is an avid Liverpool football supporter, has an unhealthy obsession with Nike trainers, loves DJing drum and bass and House music, and hopes to someday become an expert snowboarder.</p>

        <p>Kat has just returned to Canada, where she was born and raised. She loves Canada&#8217;s great outdoors especially hiking with their dogs, Kenny and Phoebe.
